## 📙 About The Project

![Mailsend Nodemailer](.github/mailsend.png)

I wanted to build an API that sends email when the user is created, then I built this simple one with nodemailer.

In this project, I tested the emails with mailtrap, this means this project is just a test with no production setup.
